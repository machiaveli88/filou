## Theming

Vilicando uses [fela](http://fela.js.org) for theming and [antd](https://ant.design/) for the standard UI components. The standard theme variables therefore also depend on the Antd variables, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less), plus:

- secondary-color
- secondary-1
  ...
- secondary-10
- grey-1
  ...
- grey-10
